Likewise Greenland also in their [Statbank](https://bank.stat.gl/pxweb/en/Greenland/) has three languages, Greenlandic, Danish and English. Both uses PX-files and PX-web to publish their tables.\n\nA main argument of developing `pxmake` from [Statistics Greenland](https://statisticsgreenland.github.io/pxmake/) was to have a good tool to handling more languages in PX-file and as we will see below it achieves just that.\n\n### The `px_languages()` function\n\nWhen making a PX-file using `pxmake` the language keyword does not have a default. So for instance, the tables we made with data from the Rwandan Labour Force Survey in the chapter [Updating PX-files](px_update_files.qmd) does not have a language set. This can easily be set to English using the function `px_language()`.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(pxmake)\n\n# Importing our px-file about labour force\npx(\"lfs_tab1.px\") %>% \n  # set language to English\n  px_language(\"en\")\n\n\npx(\"lfs_tab1.px\") %>% \n  px_language(c(\"en\", \"fr\"))\n\n\npx_language()\n```\n:::\n",
