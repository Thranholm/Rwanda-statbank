This book contain chapters for a mission from Statistics Denmark to 
The National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda on improving processes in 
the PXweb StatBank using R.

The book contains different guides on how to use R to set up a workflow
for creating PX-files (the input for a PX-web StatBank). It also contains
more general files about reading data to R and different topics,
but all with the aim to create PX-files later.

Please note that this book is currently a draft and still lacks some editing. There is ongoing work on the book, and its content may change.
