## Size matters

PX-files can contain a lot of data, which is great. However this also means that some way along the process it had required handling of this large data. The chapter [Importing data](import_data.qmd) gives some tips about handling large datasets via functions in the `haven` package with `n_max` and `col_select`. The same arguments are also available for csv-files e.g. in the function `readr::read_csv()`.



```{r}

haven::read_dta()
px_save()

```
